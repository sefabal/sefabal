<p>
Stolzenfels Castle, ehrenbreitstein Fortress, part of St. Castor basilika.
The town owes its name to the Romans who named the ‘castle’ they constructed here around 9 B.C. “castellum apud confluentes.” 
This means "castle at the confluence of the rivers”. Visitors on the trail of Koblenz’ past, find themselves caught up in the history of a town which over the centuries was captured by the Franks, 
chosen as a place of residence by German prince electors, conquered by the French and fortified by the Prussians. A truly European place.
Fortess walls and towers, castles and palaces, monuments and parks paint a vivid picture of the town’s eventful past. Koblenz was conquered 
by foreign armies and has received princes, kings, emperors and presidents within its walls. Today visitors from all over the world enjoy discovering the history and rich cultural heritage of this old town.</p>

			<th>The German Corner, or Deutsches Eck, refers to the long slip of land between the Rhine and Mosel rivers. Projecting into the fast flowing waters like the bow of a ship (it's a great spot for 
			one of those Titanic-like movie shots), the meeting place of these two mighty rivers has been an important part of the city's natural defenses since 1216 when the Order of Teutonic Knights settled here 
			(the remains of their old fortification, Deutschherrenhaus, lie nearby).In addition to its magnificent views over the rivers and the Rhine Valley, the German Corner is home to the city's 
			impressive Monument to Emperor Wilhelm I, a spectacular 37-meter-tall equestrian statue of the old king.</th>

			<th>South of Rittersturz on the outskirts of Koblenz and perched 154 meters above the Rhine stands the majestic Schloss Stolzenfels. Built in 1259 to collect river tolls, 
			the castle was expanded in the 15th century and later in the 1800s when its current Gothic Revival features were added and it became the summer residence of the King of Prussia. 
			Accessible via a 15-minute walk up a steep footpath, the castle remains one of the most romantic attractions in the region. Visitors can tour the interior where highlights include the Great Knight's Hall and the 
			former royal living quarters. Guided tours are available. </th>
