			vines in the wine city of Koblenz. Both on the Rhine and the Moselle, the winegrowers prove their outstanding skills and present the best 
			from both these famous wine growing regions. At wine and winegrower festivals, at the winegrower’s vineyard itself, in one of the traditional 
			restaurants or in one of the many wine bars,restaurants or pubs on the banks of the river, you can enjoy a couple of bottles and immerse yourself in the world of Bacchus.</th>

			You’ll find lots of cakes and tarts to tempt you in Germany, commonly made with fresh fruits. Few can resist a huge slice of the most famous of German cakes: 
			the delicious Schwarzwalder Kirschtorte, or Black Forest cherry cake. The cake is named after Schwarzwalder Kirschwasser, which is a liqueur distilled from tart cherries. 
			Alternating layers of rich chocolate cake, cherries and whipped cream are topped off with more cream, maraschino cherries and chocolate shavings.</th>
